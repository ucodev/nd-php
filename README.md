## What is the ND PHP Framework?

 ND PHP Framework is a secure, fully automated framework capable of delivering full featured web applications and respective REST API in a matter of minutes. It's licensed under [GPLv3](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html).

## How does it work?

 Based on a drag and drop builder (the IDE Builder), you'll be able to create and visualize the application model. After the model is created, hit the Deploy button and the web application will be created, ready to be used.

## Do I need to code anything at all?

 No, if the base building blocks and features of the framework already fit your needs. At this moment, this is unlikely to happen unless you only want to rely on the REST API. If not, then you'll need to extend the features by providing further parameterizations and/or code development.

## How to install it?

 Download the current framework version and follow the instructions in the [INSTALL.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ucodev/nd-php/master/INSTALL.txt) file.

## Does it run in any version of PHP?

 It requires PHP version 5.6.0 or greater. It also runs under PHP 7.

## Do I need to install a lot of dependencies?

 Probably not. Probably your GNU/Linux based operating system comes with all dependencies installed by default. Anyway, check the [INSTALL.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ucodev/nd-php/master/INSTALL.txt) file for some common exceptions that you might need to do manually.

## Does it only run on Linux?

 The framework was designed to run under any operating system that supports PHP.

## Is it ready for production?

 NO and MAYBE! This is currently a PoC. There's still a lot of work to do such as cleanups, optimizations, refactorings, etc. Use at your own risk and/or unless you really know what your doing.

## Where is the documentation?

 Before reading the documentation, you should see all (or most) of the videos located in the [documentation/videos](https://github.com/ucodev/nd-php/tree/master/documentation/videos) directory.

 The technical documentation of the framework is still being written, but there is a very incomplete version built-in.

 The framework documentation is accessible through any framework web page after installation. Just press the accesskey D (in Firefox is Alt + Shift + D) and the main documentation page will be loaded.

## How to report issues?

 Open the issue on the [ND PHP GitHub Issues Page](https://github.com/ucodev/nd-php/issues). We'll address it as soon as possible.

## Where can I get support?

 As we currently have no community support forum of our own, we encourage you to ask any technical questions on the best Q&A programming community platform available: [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com). The answer may not be that fast as there isn't a lot of people using this framework at the moment, but the question will eventually be answered :).
