Basic instructions to install the ND PHP Framework

0. See the video

  See the documentation/videos/01_Installation.mp4


1. Debian Installation

 Perform the following commands as super-user:

  # apt-get install php5-mcrypt php5-gd
  # php5enmod mcrypt gd
  # service apache2 restart
  # mysql_tzinfo_to_sql /usr/share/zoneinfo | mysql -uroot -p mysql


2. Apache Settings

 Set 'AllowOverride all' on project VirtualHost directory.

 Set the VirtualHost ErrorLog directive value to logs/error.log .


3. PHP Settings

 Edit the /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini file and set the following variables:

  max_input_vars = 20000
  auto_detect_line_endings = On
  memory_limit = 256M

 If the project is balanced with multiple web-servers, also set:

  session.use_trans_sid = 1


4. Database Configuration

 Create a new database and user under MySQL / MariaDB, granting all privileges
 to the user under the created database.

  mysql> CREATE USER 'ndphp_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'ndphp_password';
  mysql> CREATE DATABASE ndphp;
  mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ndphp.* TO 'ndphp_user'@'localhost';
  mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;


5. ND PHP Framework Settings

 If the installation process displays a warning stating that there are no write
 permissions on certain directories or files, grant that the user running the
 web-server can write on these directories or files. Typically, the following
 will solve the issues:

  # chown -R root:root nd-php/
  # chown www-data:www-data nd-php/application/controllers
  # chown -R www-data:www-data nd-php/application/controllers/lib
  # chown -R www-data:www-data nd-php/application/static/images/menu
  # chown -R www-data:www-data nd-php/backups
  # chown -R www-data:www-data nd-php/install
  # chown -R www-data:www-data nd-php/uploads
  # chown -R www-data:www-data nd-php/logs
  # chown -R www-data:www-data nd-php/user/config

 or run the following command (exactly as stated, with all the dots):

  # . ./install/perm_setup.sh.inc

 Always grant that system timezone is the same as set on the active
 Configuration timezone. Also grant that the DBMS is operating under the
 same timezone as the web-server.
